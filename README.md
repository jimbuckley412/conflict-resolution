# James Buckley's Portfolio

## Description

I created a website that will serve as a place to show off my computer and web making skills. I used basic html, css and javascript to create this website. I used a Github Repository to upload and host all my information for everyone to see. I used all the methods learned in class and more to create a lot of interesting ammenities to the site.  From this website you will be able to learn about me, check the weather, check the surf, play some fun games, do your taxes with a basic calculator, and much much more.  This website incorporates all that we have been learning so far in the class and from jumping ahead i know it will incorporate alot we will learn in the future.
This portfolio is a great place to keep all my work in clean organized place. I learned so much from this.  From increasing my basic html, css, and javaScript skills to complete the project.  I use a lot of different styling techniques to have everything run correctly and efficently.

## Installation
First I created a repository on gitHub. I created the repository jimbuckley412/bootcamp. In this repository I can store and upload all the information and coding I write from a remote branch and upload it to the main branch.
This project did not have any starter code so from using examples in the past I created the index.html file and started writing code for the site.  Basic coding for the head.  I created a reset.css sheet and a style.css sheet and finally a app.js for my javaScript in the webpage.
I typed in all the basic coding for the head linked all said sheets to my site.
Then I made a basic outline for all the aspects I wanted to include in my website.
I realized in the header I wanted a clear Title for my website I choose my full Name James Choi Buckley. In the same section I wanted to add some buttons that included About Me, My Work, Contact Me, and My Resume. 
    I MADE .button_header to make buttons for the individual options you can choose.
        THe buttons will change color and be shadowed more when you hover over it.
        I made an unordered list and then made the buttons list items.
For the next section I wanted a cool Title.
    I used the css .multicolortext to create a cool color changing waving title.
        In order to make it move I used @keyframes wave with a background-postion.
        The animation will wave at 2000ms and ease alternate infinite so forever all at a pace of .4 seconds. I choose a few different colors to get the different colored letters.
Then I created an about me section.
    In this section i utilized a flex column.
    I wanted the column to take up the whole webpage.
    It has basic information about me.
    I created the text i wanted to use the extra styles added to make it excentuate.
    I put shadowing on my flex-card.
I created a section labeled Surf Report:
    -I created a section where you can check the surf out COWABUNGA DUDES!
    -More details noted in Files.
I created a Section called Weather App.
    -I created a working Weather App you can check the weather for a specific imput loctation.
    -More details noted in files.
I created a Section called Calculator.
    -Its a basic function calculator.
    -More details in the files.
I created a Puzzle class
    -Sliding puzzle how fast can you complete it?
    -More notes in the files.
I created a Calender for important dates.
    -More notes in the files.
Finally a footer
